# Welcome!

Have you used a software that freezes the screen with every button click you made? Why are some programs slower than the others? Why are some softwares easy to use but others not? What does it mean to design programs that manipulate and store data properly? Data structures are at the heart of the answers to these questions.

This course focuses on two main topics: The basics of organizing data for efficient computation, and the design of programs that use collections, classes, and interfaces.

## What to Expect

Each week, we will explore topics in these areas interactively during lectures. You will engage in discussions and collaborative hands-on work in lectures, complete programming assignments to hone your coding and program design skills, and take quizzes that evaluate your understanding of what you have learned. By the end of the course, with sufficient effort, you will be better at designing and understanding programs and the structure of data they work over, which are stepping stones to the understanding of the technical and societal impact of software as well as more advanced topics in computer science.

On an average week in CSE12, you can expect to spend 6-8 hours on lectures, in-class group work, and discussions; and 9-12 hours working on your programming assignments and reviewing materials. If you find yourself spending dramatically more time than this, it is a good idea to contact the course staff and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, with sufficient effort, you will be able to:
- Use, implement, modify, and test various data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables and graphs.
- Analyze the runtime efficiency of different data structures and different implementations of abstract data types given specific scenarios.
- Evaluate the choice of implementation for abstract data types, data structures, and software design patterns in different engineering scenarios, given their technical and societal impact.
- Individually and collaboratively, solve substantial computational problems by using the Java programming language, object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms, considering their technical and societal impact.



## Course Format

### In-Person Lecture

Expect class to be interactive; you’ll work through problems in groups, compare multiple approaches to solutions, and answer multiple-choice questions using Google Forms (see [Engagement](#engagement) below). 

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;

  font-weight:bold;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
</style>

<table class="tg"><thead>

    <td class="tg-0pky">MW 8am-10:50am</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">FAH 1450</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Podcasts will be available after lectures. However, attendance is strongly encouraged – every lecture we will spend time designing **sample exam questions** together. The questions you create and see might end up being the real exam questions.

### Discussion

Discussions will reinforce concepts from class and introduce concepts that are especially helpful for completing programming assignments and exams. There will be podcasts/recordings for discussions. 

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Time</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Location</th>

    <td class="tg-c3ow">Tu: Zoom; Th: FAH 1450</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


In general, there will be two kinds of discussions:
- **Tuesday** online discussions will review concepts discussed so far and provide tips for the programming assignments (PAs) of a given week.
- **Thursday** in-person discussions (except Week 1) will review for the quiz/final exam of that week.


# Course Logistics

## Instructional Staff
**Instructor**: Lisa Huang ([r6huang+cse12@ucsd.edu](mailto:r6huang+cse12@ucsd.edu))

**Teaching Assistant**: Rachel Lim ([ral077@ucsd.edu](mailto:ral077@ucsd.edu))

**Tutors**: Kristhian Ortiz ([klortiz@ucsd.edu](mailto:klortiz@ucsd.edu)) and Wenhua Tang [w7tang@ucsd.edu](mailto:w7tang@ucsd.edu)

More details about staff and help hours: use the ["Help Hours" link](/help-hours.html) on the left navigation bar


## Textbook

There is no required textbook for the course. There is a Stepik online textbook available, and it is free and interactive! It serves as a useful reference, and there will be links to relevant stepik sections in with the course schedule. While we will not grade the exercises in Stepik, you are expected to complete them before relevant lectures so that you will be prepared to participate in problem solving session and so that you know the expected pace of the course.

1. Sign in or create an account at [stepik.org](stepik.org)
2. [Join the course here](https://stepik.org/join-class/1654e15658a8ee31ababe65adb761d4901c21714){:target="_blank"}

We may use other on-line resources during the quarter that may be required reading or activities. These will all be free and linked from the schedule.

## Online Discussion and Q&A
Online discussion and Q&A for the class will be available on Piazza: [sign up to join the class here](https://piazza.com/ucsd/summer2024/cse12) and [view the discussion forum here](https://piazza.com/ucsd/summer2024/cse12/home). Important announcements from the course team will be pinned at the top of your feed. When you set up your account, you can select the frequency for email notifications of messages and discussions on Piazza. Piazza is one way you can ask for and get help in this course.

## Programming Environment
While you are welcome to use your preferred programming environment for assignments, such as Eclipse and IntelliJ, the officially supported environment for CSE 12 is **VSCode**. The course staff is most familiar with VSCode and may not be able to help you with environment issue if you choose to use a different environment. If you do not already have a programming environment for Java installed and would like to use VSCode, please complete [PA0: Computer Set up](/assignments/pa0.html){:target="_blank"}. 

## Java Documentation
[The documentation for the Java language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/11/), while not required reading, will be linked to from some assignments and is always a useful reference while programming. You can install any version higher than 8. The latest version is Java 22. If you would like to set everything up on your own computer and do not already have Java installed please complete [PA0: Computer Set up](/assignments/pa0.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Working on and Submitting Assignments
You’ll be submitting your classwork and seeing grading feedback through a tool called Gradescope. This is the [Gradescope page for this course](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/799152).

You’ll be receiving starter code through a service called Github. You are not required to have an account to complete coursework, but it can be useful for you to make one.



# Assignments, Exams, and Grading

## Grades
Your grade will be computed from:

- [Engagement](#engagement) (10%; Extra credit: 10%)
- [Programming Assignments (PAs)](#programming-assignments-pas) (30%)
- [Exams](#exams) (60%)

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following grading scale:

![Grades](grades.png)

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient 
(depending on a number of factors that we will not publicize), but we guarantee 
that we will not adjust the scale to make it harder to get a better grade. 
We will not adjust the scale for individual students.  

## Engagement

We highly recommend actively participating in class, attending discussion, and completing the weekly review quizzes. Regularly engaging with the class in these ways counts towards the Engagement component of your overall score.

This score is calculated on a weekly basis (starting in Week 1). You need 6 points per week to earn full credit. The maximum number of points you can earn in one week is 12, which might give you extra credit.

Earn engagement points by:
- **In class participation via Google Forms (6 points max each week)**: In Weeks 1 through 5, you will earn credit for attending and participating in lecture (2 points each) and discussion section (1 point each; the discussion in Week 2 would worth 2 points). Lecture/Discussion participation will be recorded via Google Forms that you will fill out during lecture/discussion. We have you respond to problems in lecture/discussion because there is quite a bit of evidence that sitting and listening passively [probably isn’t the best way to teach or learn science](https://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963). You must submit these questions during the lecture/discussion. _These questions will be graded for participation only and not for correctness of the response._
- **Weekly (P)review quiz (6 points max each week)**: Online quizzes review the week’s material and preview some upcoming examples each week. Each weekly review quiz will be worth 6 points. You can submit your answers to each quiz as many times as you like. The latest submission before 11pm on Monday will count towards your engagement score. **Review quizzes will be graded for correctness.** _The review quiz must be completed independently and individually. You may refer to your class notes and resources linked from this website, but not to other references. You may not share information about the review quiz with others, take the review quiz in someone else’s name, or ask anyone for prior knowledge about the review quiz._

We encourage you to find your preferred method for staying engaged with the course. There are lots of ways to earn full credit for a week’s engagement. For example: (1) attending all lectures and discussion sections;  (2) answering all questions on the review quiz correctly; or (3) attending two lectures and getting two points on the review quiz; etc. If you decide to complete review quizzes on top of attending all lectures and discussions, you will get extra credit for your course grade.


## Programming Assignments (PAs)

Most weeks there will be a programming assignment. Direct practice with
programming will make up the majority of your work in the course.

There are several opportunities to get feedback on your work and improve:

- **Shortly after the deadline** for each assignment, the autograded portion
will automatically grade your submitted code and for the manually graded portion,
a staff member will grade your work and get feedback on what, if anything, you need to fix.

- **After you receive your grade** you can continue to improve your assignment
based on the feedback from grading. You can resubmit your work to the Late/Resubmit 
submission which will be open for **one week** (less for the last PA). Once the Late/Resubmit submission closes, your submission will again be graded. 

There is no penalty for resubmissions, you can still earn up to full credit. 
We will take the highest score between your original submission and your late/resubmission.

The **Late/Resubmit** process also applies if your submission is late. You should strive
to complete each PA before it's posted deadline as the PAs are practice for the exams.
You will also receive earlier feedback and an extra grading attempt if you submit
before the original deadline.

For those assignments near the end of the quarter, the deadline for all late/resubmissions 
will be Friday of Week 5 (8/2) at 11pm. We will not accept any submissions after that time, for any reason.

It's the student's responsibilty to check that the autograder worked and that all files
have been properly uploaded (by checking the Code tab). We only accept PAs through
Gradescope. We will not accept any files through email, Canvas, or
Piazza.

### Collaboration

**This is not the same collaboration policy you have seen in your other
programming courses. Read it carefully.**

In your professional programming life, some of your work will be highly
collaborative with lots of expert advice available from senior developers and
from sites like StackOverflow. This is a common case in companies, in
academia, and on open-source projects. It's a great way to get exposed to new
techniques, share knowledge, and generally enjoy teamwork. In contrast, some
of your work will involve figuring out programming problems on your own,
where you are the first person to encounter an issue, or the first person to
try using a new library in the context of your application. You should get
experience in both types of situations; we might call the former kind of
problem **open to collaboration** and the latter **closed to collaboration**.

In terms of courses, this split also makes sense. Programming assignments
serve (at least) two roles. First and foremost, they are a mechanism for you
to learn! By directly applying the techniques and skills we discuss in class,
you get practice and become a better programmer. Second, they are an
assessment mechanism – as instructional staff we use them to evaluate your
understanding of concepts as demonstrated by your programs. Open
collaboration can reduce frustration while learning and give you chances to
enjoy collaboration and lots of help, but may not let us accurately evaluate
your understanding. Closed assignments are an opportunity for
you to demonstrate what you know by way of programming.

There are two types of assignments in this course, **open** and **closed**:

- **Open** assignments, for which you can talk to anyone else
  in the course, post snippets of code on Piazza, get lots of help from TAs,
  and generally come up with solutions collaboratively. TAs will be happy to
  look at your code and suggest approaches and fixes.
  
  There are a few restrictions:
  - Any code that you didn't write must be cited in the comments at the top of all of your submitted code files.

    **Example:** On an open assignment, you and another
    student chat online about the solution, you figure out a particular
    helper method together. Your comment should say “//The FOO function was
    developed in collaboration with Firstname Lastname”

    **Example:** On an open assignment, a student posts the
    recursive method calls they used to solve a problem you were
    struggling with. Your comment should say “//I used the code from
    https://piazza.com/class/id-of-post”.

    **Example:** You and another student sit next to each other,
    and point out mistakes and errors to one another as you work through
    the assignment. As a result, your solutions are substantially similar.
    Your comment should say “//I collaborated with Firstname Lastname to
    develop my solution.”

  - You cannot share an entire repository of code or paste an entire solution
    into Piazza. Keep snippets to reasonable, descriptive chunks of code; think
    a dozen lines or so to get the point across.
  - You still _cannot_ use code that you find online (no copying code
    from StackOverflow or blogs online), or get assistance or code from
    students outside of this offering of the class. All the code that is
    handed in should be developed by you or someone in the class.
  - You are responsible for _understanding_ all the code you have written.
    All of the programming problems on the PAs may show up on exams, where
    you will need to have a thorough understanding of the PA to answer the
    questions.

  This doesn't mean the staff will be handing out answers. We'll mostly
  respond with leading questions and advice, and you shouldn't expect a
  direct answer to questions like “am I done?” or “is my code right?”

  There is no guarantee the assistance you get from your classmates is
  correct. It is your responsibility to use your judgment to avoid using an
  idea on Piazza that is wrong, or doesn't work with your solution; we won't
  necessarily tell you one way or another while the assignment is out.

  If we see that you used code from other students and didn't cite it at the top
  of your file, the penalty will range from a point deduction to an academic
  integrity violation, depending on the severity. Always cite your work!

  Note: collaboration does not mean turning in the same file. Collaboration is
  different than partners or pair programming. You must still do your own work.

- **Closed** assignments, where you cannot collaborate with others. The closed 
assignments serve as programming assessments (exams). You cannot ask 
clarification questions but you can report potential issues as private posts on
Piazza or to staff members. Staff will not look at your code or comment on it. 
They will not answer questions about closed assignments during Lab/Office hours.
These programming assesments are take-home exams.

  On closed assignments/assessments:
    - You cannot look at or use anyone else's code in any way.
    - You cannot discuss the assignment, even in general terms, with anyone.
    - You should expect that staff members will politely say “The course
      policy says I can't help with that” if you ask a question about your
      algorithm or code.
    - You cannot post publicly about the assignment on Piazza or elsewhere
      online.
    - All of the examples in the open section above would be
      academic integrity violations.

**Programming assignments will explicitly list whether they are open or closed collaboration.**

You should be familiar with [the UCSD guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2){:target="_blank"}
on academic integrity as well.

Do not post your PA solutions publicly on any site, including Github. If you fork the Github starter code repos
and upload your code to the repo, you are required to make the repo private. It is an academic integrity
violation to publicly post your code. This remains true even after the course is over. If you with to 
share the code wish an employer in the future, upload the code to Google Drive or Dropbox and share
the link to the folder.

## Exams

There will be three **quizzes** during the quarter, in FAH 1450 (same as lecture room):
- Week 2 - Friday 7/12/2024, 9am - 10am
- Week 3 - Wednesday 7/19/2024, 9am - 10am
- Week 4 - Wednesday 7/26/2024, 9am - 10am

The **final exam** will be:
- Week 5 - Friday 8/2/2024, 8am - 11am, room will be announced later in the quarter. 

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations). You may not speak to any other student in the exam room while the exam is in progress (including after you hand in your own exam). You may not share any information about the exam with any student who has not yet taken it (including students in future quarters of CSE 12).

**Quizzes**: Each quiz will each be worth 15% of your final grade. 

**Final Exam**: The final exam will be worth 15% of your final grade and broken into four parts, three parts of which correspond to the material from one of the quizzes. The fourth part will be materials not covered in prior quizzes. Your grade for each quiz will be the maximum of the quiz score and the score on the corresponding part of the final exam. Your grade for the final exam, however, will be the total score of all parts. In other words, all parts of the final exam is required. Skipping or scoring lower on parts of the final exam will not affect your quiz grades, but will affect your final exam grade.


For example:
- On the three quizzes you score 75, 0, and 95 (you miss the second). On the final exam you score 80, 75, and 0 on quiz-corresponding parts, and 90 on the new part. Your exam scores are 80, 75, 95, (80 + 75 + 0 + 90) / (100 * 4) = 61.25, giving you an exam grade of 46.69% (12% + 11.25% + 14.25% + 9.19%) out of 60%.
- On the three in-class exams you score 95, 93, and 90. You skip the final so your scores are 0, 0, 0, 0. Your exam scores are 95, 93, 90, 0, giving you an exam grade of 41.7% (14.25% + 13.95% + 13.5% + 0%) out of 60%.
- On the three in-class exams you score 75, 55, and 60. On the final you score 95, 90, 94, 98. Your exam scores are 95, 90, 94, (95 + 90 + 94 + 98) / (100 * 4) = 94.25, giving you an exam grade of 55.99% (14.25% + 13.5% + 14.1% + 14.14%) out of 60%.

**Make-up Exams**: This policy also covers what happens if you miss a quiz for any reason. If you are absent for a quiz, you get a 0, and then whatever score you get on the final exam for that section will be applied to your quiz grade. There are no make-up quiz, and the final exam policy is governed by the [university’s policies](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/){:target="_blank"}.

# Policies

## Academic Integrity

Individual assignments will describe their academic integrity requirements. You
should pay attention to the descriptions of what collaboration is allowed and
expected on each assignment.

One challenge we face as an instructional team is verifying that students are
submitting their own work given the number of remote and asynchronous options we
provide. In the past, we relied on in-person, ID-checked exams to mitigate this
particular challenge to academic integrity. Assignments and exams will come with
specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but we have one
course-wide policy – we may reach out to students to schedule a check-in on
their understanding of work they've submitted if we're suspicious about an
academic integrity violation.  This would involve a video conference with a TA or
instructor to check that the student has the understanding demonstrated by their
work. This is in addition to any video screencasts that are submitted as a part
of the exam.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2){:target="_blank"}
on academic integrity as well.

## Use of Generative AI

These following policies regarding generative artificial intelligence use apply only in CSE 12 Summer 2024, and may not necessarily apply in other classes at UCSD or reflect the university’s stance on AI use in education.

_TL;DR_: You may use AI, but you should use it with caution. In CSE 12, you cannot use AI for closed PAs, review quizzes, or exams.

**Can I use generative AI for assignments?**

Yes, you can use Generative AI for **open PAs** only. Generative AI (e.g., tools like ChatGPT, Github Copilot) can be a powerful tool to support your own learning. In CSE 12, we encourage you to use AI responsibly, or else you may risk failing exams and cthe closed PAs. If you use AI to help you on a PA, we would like you to briefly cite how you used AI in a comment. This citation allows us to understand the role of AI in the learning process, and will not impact your grade.

**Does that mean I can use generative AI to do all my assignments for me?**

No. You may use AI for open PAs only. We require that you can understand the material on your own. If you do use AI to help you learn or complete assignments, be sure that you’re able to understand everything on your own. However, **you can’t use AI for closed PAs, review quizzes, or during exams!** We could tell if AI is used in closed PAs (just like how we could tell cheating). Since review quizzes resemble real exam questions, using AI for review quizzes is not going to help you with exams. Cases caught will result in violations of academic integrity. 

**For assignments where AI is allowed, how can I use generative AI to help me learn?**

Some of the most well-known generative AI tools available are designed to be chatbots (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Claude,  etc.), so one way to approach using AI is to treat them like a friend in this class. For example:
- You can ask an AI chatbot to explain a snippet of code to you, and you can ask follow up questions.
- You can give an AI chatbot a snippet of code and an error message, and you can ask it to help you debug your program.

**What should I be aware of when using generative AI?**

While generative AI tools may seem intelligent, it is important to recognize that there are significant limitations, including but not limited to:
- AI can make up facts and pretend to know things it doesn’t. Be sure to double-check any information it tells you if you’re unsure.
- AI may be able to write code well, but don’t let this replace your own learning. Being able to read, write, and understand code on your own are critical skills for programmers. If you are interested in programming-related jobs, skills taught in CSE 12 are fundamental in technical interviews; to land on one of those jobs, you want to make sure _you_ have acquired the skills, not AI!

**I have other questions about using generative AI in CSE 12.**

We encourage you to ask any questions about our policies publicly on Edstem, or directly to the instructor or the TAs via email or during office hours. Figuring out how to work with generative AI is a new challenge for both students and educators, so we encourage you to have an open discussion about it!
UCSD provides additional resources for students about how to use generative AI in a way that upholds academic integrity.

UCSD Library: [https://ucsd.libguides.com/c.php?g=1322935](https://ucsd.libguides.com/c.php?g=1322935)

## Late or Missed Assignments/Exams
The [Assignments, Exams, and Grading] section details which assignments can be submitted late or missed without penalty. In summary:
- [Engagement](#engagement) grades can be earned in various ways but no late submissions will be accepted. 
- [Programming Assignments (PAs)](#programming-assignments-pas) can be resubmitted/late until up to one week after the deadline; the last PA must be submitted by the final exam day.
- [Exams](#exams): Missed quizzes can be "retaken" during the final exam. No exam can be taken late.

## Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow **two days** for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.

# Resources for Students

If you need help at any time this quarter, please contact the instructor, the TA, or the tutors. We are happy to work with you. You may also post general questions on Piazza.

The IDEA Engineering Student Center, located just off the lobby of Jacobs Hall, is a hub for student engagement, academic enrichment, personal/professional development, leadership, community involvement, and a respectful learning environment for all. The Center offers a variety of programs, listed in the IDEA Center Facebook page at [http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/](http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/) and the Center web site at [http://idea.ucsd.edu/](http://idea.ucsd.edu/). The IDEA Center programs support both undergraduate students and graduate students.

## Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.). Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive. 

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input. 

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community ([https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html)). Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different from your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination: [https://ophd.ucsd.edu/](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/). 

## Students with Disabilities

We aim to create an environment in which all students can succeed in this course. If you have a disability, please contact the Office for Students with Disability (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall, to discuss appropriate accommodations right away. We will work to provide you with the accommodations you need, but you must first provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the OSD. You are required to present their AFA letters to Faculty (please make arrangements to contact the instructor privately) and to the OSD Liaison in the department in advance so that accommodations may be arranged.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I have to participate if I’m on the waitlist?**

Yes, you’re responsible for everything as if you’re a normally-enrolled student while you’re on the waitlist, including any submission deadlines, and your work will be graded as usual.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist. E.g., How likely is it for me to get into this class?**

Please contact [CSE student affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours){:target=”_blank”}, who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses){:target=”_blank”} that likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**Will the course be in-person or remote? Is attendance required?**

The content of the course is delivered in-person, except for Tuesday discussions, which will be on Zoom. You can revisit lectures and discussions remotely on UCSD Podcast (accessed via Canvas) _after_ they are delivered in person. Attendance is not required, but is highly recommended (check [Engagement](#engagement)). Studies (by UCSD faculty) have shown that attendance and participation in lecture leads to better student performance and higher grades.

**Can I take an exam remotely?**
No. All exams, including quizzes and the final exam, will be in person.

**Can I take an exam early/late?**
- For quizzes, we will not offer accommodations as one may retake them during the final exam (see [Exams](#exams)). Quizzes will be released to all students after grades are released for practice purposes.
- For the final exam, we will provide accommodations following the [university policy](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/) for unforseeable circumstances including serious illness and family emergencies. Please contact the instructor when requesting accommodations.
- We will also accommodate final exams in conflict with finals of other courses. Please email the instructor screenshots of your WebReg record showing the conflict.

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the course](https://ucsd-cse12-sp24.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, which will give you a sense. This offering will cover the similar topics covered in prior iterations.
However, because of the uniqueness of summer sessions, there will be differences in pace and focus.

There is no required textbook for you to purchase for the course. The course uses a combination of online resources and notes from the instructor.

**Can I audit the course?**

You can use all the public resources on this website, and if you're a UCSD
community member, you can view all the podcasts for the problem sessions at
[https://podcast.ucsd.edu/](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/). Beyond that we don't
have any formalized support for auditing the course.

**Do we need a clicker for this class?**

No. We use Gradescope to collect Engagement credit.
