# UCSD CSE 12 Summer 2024
## Asking Questions and Getting Help

There are 4 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your
learning, and a few different ways to get in touch and ask for help.

  - You have permission to use _any_ lab, but prefer to use the B240 lab if space is available, that's where our staff will be based -->

**Do NOT use the Canvas mailing feature to contact us. We will NOT respond to those messages.** 
If you need to send a private message to the instructor, you can email her at [r6huang+cse12@ucsd.edu](mailto:r6huang+cse12@ucsd.edu) (but any course related questions should ideally be through Piazza).

## Piazza Message Board Questions

You can post questions on our Piazza message board at any time:
[https://piazza.com/ucsd/summer2024/cse12](https://piazza.com/ucsd/summer2024/cse12){:target="_blank"}

The message board is a good place for questions about something that was
confusing in class, in videos, in the book, or generally about course content.
It's not always the best place for help with programming details on your
assignments (remote or in-person lab hours are better for that). If you do post
for help with a programming assignment, we ask that you use good judgment in how
much code you share ‚Äì sharing too much as part of your question could harm
others' learning if they aren't expecting to see parts of a solution. 

Feel free to engage with your classmates and help answer their questions. Always
be polite and assume the best intentions. Always assume that the person you're
talking to is asking an honest question, and don't assume they ‚Äúshould know‚Äù
something; if they seem to not know something from the course, reminding them
with a link to where it was taught can be useful (instead of saying something
like ‚Äúthat was already covered‚Äù). Try to guide your classmates to useful
conclusions on their own rather than solving their problems for them. Using
emoji can always help with a positive and friendly vibe üôÇ

**Note:** During the times where we have closed PAs, Piazza will not
allow posting public to the class, including requests for clarifications. The staff will announce to the entire class when there is a need.
